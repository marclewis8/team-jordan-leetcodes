# Writing a Solution

+ **Recommended file name** when pushing a solution to the repo: **[Q#]-[name]-[file_extension]** (e.g. **328-odd-even-linked-list.py**)
+ **Recommended commit name** when pushing a solution to the repo: **[Q#]-[name]_[language]** (e.g. **328-odd-even-linked-list_python**)

You can add any problem that you solve on your own or with a group! Just make sure to add comments detailing how you approached the problem at the beginning/inside of the code to help others understand it. A sample solution in Python might look like:

```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#   def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#       self.val = val
#       self.next = next

# Here I would write out my solution notes. Fully fleshed out solution notes might include:
# Time and space complexity
# Specific foundational concepts that helped lead to the solution (e.g. Concepts used: Fast-slow pointers, DFS, Djikstras, etc.)
# A simplified explanation of how your code works that led to your solution

class Solution:
